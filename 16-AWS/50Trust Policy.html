A JSON document attached to your IAM role.
A trust policy is a type of AWS resource policy that controls which principals can assume a role and under what conditions. The trust policy essentially enforces "who can wear this hat" and under what circumstances. You can think of the trust policy as the "front door" to a role—before anyone can use the permissions defined in the role, they must first pass the trust policy to verify their eligibility.

I have two accounts: Account A and Account B.
An IAM user in Account A wants to access an S3 bucket in Account B.
Steps:
1.	Create an IAM role in Account B and grant it access to S3
2.	Within this IAM role, create a trust policy that allows all entities from Account A to assume this role
3.	In Account A, attach a policy to the IAM user that grants permission to assume the role in Account B
Trust Policy Principals:
In a trust policy, you can define principals in several ways:
•	AWS Account: Allow all entities in an account (e.g., "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root")
•	Specific IAM User: Allow a specific user (e.g., "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/username")
•	IAM Role: Allow another role to assume this role
•	AWS Service: Allow an AWS service (e.g., "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com")
