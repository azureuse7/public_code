### IAM
Idenity and Access managment 

### Components of IAM 

##### Users:
IAM users represent individual people or entities 

##### Groups: 
- IAM groups are collections of users with similar access requirements.
- Instead of managing permissions for each user individually, you can assign permissions to groups, making it easier to manage access control.
- Users can be added or removed from groups as needed.

#### Roles: 
- IAM roles are used to grant temporary access to AWS resources. 
- Roles are typically used by applications or services that need to access AWS resources on behalf of users or other services. 
- Roles have associated policies that define the permissions and actions allowed for the role.

#### Policies: 
- IAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions. 
- Policies specify the actions that can be performed on AWS resources and the resources to which the actions apply. 
- Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles to control access. 
- IAM provides both AWS managed policies (predefined policies maintained by AWS) and customer managed policies (policies created and managed by you).
