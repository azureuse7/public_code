#### Entry point check

In Python, the **entry point check** is a common programming pattern used to determine whether a Python file is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module into another script. This check is typically done using the following code snippet:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
# Code to execute when the file is run as a script
```
**How It Works**

1. **The \_\_name\_\_ Variable**:
   Every Python module has a built-in attribute called **\_\_name\_\_.** When a module is run directly, Python sets **\_\_name\_\_** to the string **"\_\_main\_\_".**
   1. **When running as a script**:
      If you run your Python file directly (e.g., **python my\_script.**py), then **\_\_name\_\_** will equal **"\_\_main\_\_".**
   2. **When imported as a module**:
      If the same file is imported into another script (e.g., **import my\_script)**, then **\_\_name\_\_** will equal the module's name (e.g., **"my\_script").**
2. **Purpose of the Check**:
   The entry point check allows you to separate code that should only run when the script is executed directly from code (such as function and class definitions) that could be reused when the module is imported. This is especially useful for:
   1. **Testing or Demonstration Purposes**: You can include sample usage or test code in your module that only runs when the module is executed directly.
   2. **Modular Code Design**: It ensures that certain code (e.g., initialization routines, main logic) doesn't run when you only want to import the module's functions or classes into another module.

**Example**

Consider a Python file called calculator.py:

python
```python
# calculator.py

def add(a, b):
    """Return the sum of two numbers."""
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    """Return the difference between two numbers."""
    return a - b

def main():
    # Code in main() runs only when the script is executed directly
    print("Testing the calculator functions:")
    print("3 + 5 =", add(3, 5))
    print("10 - 7 =", subtract(10, 7))

# Entry point check
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
**When Running as the Main Program:**

- Command: python calculator.py
- Behavior: Python sets \_\_name\_\_ to "\_\_main\_\_", so the if condition is True and main() is called. The script outputs:

  bash
```
  Testing the calculator functions:

  3 + 5 = 8
  10 - 7 = 3
```
**When Importing the Module:**

- Another file, say app.py, imports calculator:

  python

```python
  # app.py

  import calculator

  result = calculator.add(2, 2)
  print("2 + 2 =", result)
```
- Behavior: When **calculator.py** is imported, **\_\_name\_\_** in that context is "calculator", not "\_\_main\_\_". Thus, the **if **condition evaluates to **False** and **main()** is not executed. Only the functions **add** and **subtract** become available to the importing script.

**Benefits**

- **Prevents Unwanted Execution**: Avoids running script-specific code upon import, which could lead to unexpected behavior or performance issues.
- **Improves Code Reusability**: Keeps utility functions and classes available for reuse in other modules without triggering execution code.
- **Facilitates Testing**: You can include test cases or demonstrations in your module that are executed only when needed.

**Conclusion**

The entry point check (**if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_":**) is a simple yet powerful Python idiom that makes your code more modular, testable, and reusable. By understanding and using this pattern, you can design Python programs that work correctly both as standalone applications and as importable modules in larger projects.
