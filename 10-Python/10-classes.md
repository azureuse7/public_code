#### Key Concepts of Classes in Python

Syntax to define a class:
```
class ClassName:
    # Class body: Attributes and methods
```
**Example**:
```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age    # Instance attribute

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name}." #self is like this 

# Creating an instance (object) of the class
person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
print(person1.greet())  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice.
```

####  Class Components

1)  **Attributes**: Variables that hold data associated with a class and its objects.

- **Instance**  Unique to each object.
- **Class** **Attributes**: Shared across all instances of the class.
  
2) **Methods**: Functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object.

#### The __init__ Method

- Special method called a constructor.
- Automatically invoked when creating a new instance of a class.
- Used to initialize instance attributes.
Example:

```
class Circle:
    pi = 3.1416  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius  # Instance attribute

    def area(self):
        return self.pi * (self.radius ** 2)

circle1 = Circle(5)
print(circle1.area())  # Output: 78.54
```
#### Inheritance

- Inheritance allows a new class to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class.

Example:

```
class Animal:
    def eat(self):
        return "This animal is eating."

class Dog(Animal):  # Dog inherits from Animal
    def bark(self):
        return "Woof!"

dog = Dog()
print(dog.eat())   # Output: This animal is eating.
print(dog.bark())  # Output: Woof!
```

#### Encapsulation

- Encapsulation restricts access to methods and variables to prevent data from direct modification.

- **Private** **Attributes**: Prefix with double underscores __ to make an attribute private.

```
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

account = BankAccount(1000)
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500
```
#### Polymorphism

- Polymorphism allows methods to use objects of different types.

```
class Cat:
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

def make_sound(animal):
    print(animal.speak())

cat = Cat()
dog = Dog()

make_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow!
make_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof!
```

#### Special Methods (Magic Methods)

- Special methods allow you to define how objects of your class behave with built-in functions and operators.

Common Special Methods:
__str__(self): Defines behavior for str() and print().
__len__(self): Defines behavior for len().
__add__(self, other): Defines behavior for the + operator.
```
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

v1 = Vector(2, 4)
v2 = Vector(3, -1)
v3 = v1 + v2
print(v3)  # Output: Vector(5, 3)
```
#### Class vs. Instance Attributes

Class Attributes: Shared by all instances of the class.
Instance Attributes: Unique to each instance.

```
class Car:
    wheels = 4  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color  # Instance attribute

car1 = Car("red")
car2 = Car("blue")

print(car1.wheels)  # Output: 4
print(car2.wheels)  # Output: 4
print(car1.color)   # Output: red
print(car2.color)   # Output: blue
Access Modifiers in Python
```

While Python doesn't enforce access modifiers, naming conventions indicate the intended level of access:

Public: No underscores (e.g., name)
Protected: Single underscore prefix (e.g., _name)
Private: Double underscore prefix (e.g., __name)
Static Methods and Class Methods

Static Methods: Defined using @staticmethod. They don't access instance (self) or class (cls) variables.
Class Methods: Defined using @classmethod. They receive the class (cls) as the first argument instead of the instance.

```
class MathOperations:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @classmethod
    def info(cls):
        return f"This is a {cls.__name__} class."

print(MathOperations.add(5, 7))   # Output: 12
print(MathOperations.info())      # Output: This is a MathOperations 
```
class.
#### Summary

Classes: Templates for creating objects.
Objects: Instances of classes.
Attributes: Variables that hold data.
Methods: Functions that perform actions.
Inheritance: Mechanism to create a new class using details of an existing class.
Encapsulation: Restricting access to methods and variables.
Polymorphism: Ability to use a common interface for multiple forms (data types).
