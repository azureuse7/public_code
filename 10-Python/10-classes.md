#### Key Concepts of Classes in Python
##### 1. Class Definition
- A class defines the structure and behavior of objects.
- Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) that operate on the data.

Syntax to define a class:
```
class ClassName:
    # Class body: Attributes and methods
```
**Example**:
```
class Dog:
    # Class attribute
    species = "Canis familiaris"

    # Instance initializer method
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance attributes
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # Instance method
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"
```

- **Dog** is the class name.
- The __init__ method is a constructor that initializes object attributes (name, age) when an object is created.
- The **bark** method is a behavior (function) associated with objects of the Dog class.
#### 2. Object Creation (Instance)
- An object is an instance of a class. It is created using the class blueprint and has its own specific attributes and behaviors.
```
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)  # Create an instance of Dog
print(my_dog.name)        # Access attribute -> Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.bark())      # Call method -> Output: Buddy says Woof!
```
- Here, **my_dog** is an instance of the **Dog** class. It has attributes **name** and **age**, and it can perform the action **bark**().

#### 3. Attributes
Attributes are variables that belong to a class or object. Python supports two types of attributes:

- **Class** **Attributes**: These are shared across all instances of the class.
- **Instance** **Attributes**: These are specific to each instance (object) of the class.
Example:

```
class Dog:
    # Class attribute
    species = "Canis familiaris"

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance attributes
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

In this example, species is a class attribute (common to all dogs), while name and age are instance attributes (specific to each dog).

#### 4. Methods
Methods are functions defined within a class that act on an objectâ€™s attributes. They describe the behaviors of an object.

- **Instance** **Methods**: These take self as their first parameter, referring to the instance calling the method.
- **Class** **Methods**: Defined using the @classmethod decorator, these take cls as the first parameter and operate on the class rather than the instance.
- **Static** **Methods**: Defined using the @staticmethod decorator, these do not take self or cls as the first parameter and do not access or modify the class or instance attributes.
Example:

```
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # Instance method
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

    # Class method
    @classmethod
    def change_species(cls, new_species):
        cls.species = new_species

    # Static method
    @staticmethod
    def is_adult(age):
        return age > 2
```

**Usage**:
```
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)

# Call instance method
print(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!

# Call class method
Dog.change_species("Canis lupus")
print(Dog.species)  # Output: Canis lupus

# Call static method
print(Dog.is_adult(3))  # Output: True
```


#### 5. __init__ Method
The __init__ method, also known as the constructor, is automatically invoked when a new object is created. It initializes the object's attributes.

Example:
```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

When a **Person** object is created, the __init__ method is called, initializing **name** and **age** for that object.

#### 6. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and extends functionality.
```
Syntax:

class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    # Child class inherits all attributes and methods of ParentClass
```

Example:
```
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def sound(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.name)   # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.sound())  # Output: Woof!
```

In this example, the **Dog** class inherits from the **Animal** class and overrides the **sound** method.

#### 7. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a class. It also involves restricting direct access to certain data by making attributes or methods private using underscores **(_ or __).**

Example:
```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self._name = name  # Protected attribute
        self.__age = age   # Private attribute

    def get_age(self):
        return self.__age

person = Person("Alice", 30)
print(person._name)        # Output: Alice
print(person.get_age())    # Output: 30
```

- **_name**: This is a convention indicating that the attribute is protected, i.e., should not be accessed directly outside the class.
- **__age**: This is a private attribute that cannot be accessed directly outside the class. Instead, a method (get_age) is used to access it.
#### 8. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a shared interface. This can be implemented using method overriding or by using the same method name for different behaviors.

Example:
```

class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Woof"

def make_sound(animal):
    print(animal.sound())

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

make_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof
make_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow
```


The **make_sound** function works for both **Dog** and **Cat** because both classes implement a **sound** method.

#### 9. Abstraction
Abstraction hides the internal details of how an object works, exposing only the necessary functionalities. This is often done by defining abstract methods in a parent class and forcing child classes to implement them.

Example using the **abc** (Abstract Base Classes) module:
```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Animal(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

my_dog = Dog()
print(my_dog.sound())  # Output: Woof!
```


The **Animal** class is abstract, and the **sound** method must be implemented by child classes.
