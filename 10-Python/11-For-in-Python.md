def main():
    for x in range(1, 6):
        print()
        for y in range(1, 11):

#### This script generates multiplication tables for numbers 1 through 5. Each table displays the product of the number with integers from 1 to 10.

- def main():         --> Defines a function named main

##### Outer Loop: 
- for x               -->> Iterates over each integer in the range,
- in range(1, 6):     --> Generates a sequence of integers from 1 to 5
- print() -->  Inserts a blank line before each multiplication table for better readability 

##### Inner Loop:

- range(1, 11): Generates integers from 1 to 10.
- y: Iterates over each integer, representing the multiplier in the multiplication table

##### Printing the Multiplication Statement:
```
print(f"{x} x {y} = {x * y}")
```

- f"{x} x {y} = {x * y}": Utilizes an f-string (formatted string literal) to embed expressions inside string literals.
- {x} and {y}: Placeholders that are replaced with the current values of x and y.
- {x * y}: Evaluates the product of x and y and embeds the result into the string.
###### Example Output: If x is 2 and y is 3, it prints 2 x 3 = 6.

##### Entry Point Check:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

- __name__: A special built-in variable in Python that represents the name of the current module.
- When a Python file is run directly, __name__ is set to '__main__'.
If the file is imported as a module in another script, __name__ is set to the module's name.
- Purpose: Ensures that the main() function is executed only when the script is run directly, and not when it's imported as a module elsewhere. This is a common Python idiom for making code reusable and preventing certain code blocks from executing unintentionally.


##### Execution Flow
1) Script Start:

- When you run the script, Python sets __name__ to '__main__'.
2) Check and Call main():

- The condition if __name__ == '__main__': evaluates to True, so main() is called.
3) Inside main():

- Outer Loop (x from 1 to 5):
- For each x, it prints an empty line for spacing.
- Inner Loop (y from 1 to 10):
- For each y, it prints the multiplication statement using the current values of x and y.
##### Output:

- The program prints multiplication tables for numbers 1 through 5, each ranging from multiplying by 1 up to 10.
```

1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
...
1 x 10 = 10

2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
...
2 x 10 = 20

...
5 x 10 = 50
```
(Note: Each table is separated by a blank line for clarity.)

#### Key Concepts Illustrated
1) Functions: Encapsulating code within functions (main()) enhances readability and maintainability.

2) Loops:

- for Loops: Iterate over a sequence of numbers generated by range().
- Nested Loops: Using a loop inside another loop to handle multi-dimensional iterations (e.g., rows and columns).
3) Formatted Strings (f-strings): Allow embedding expressions inside string literals, making string construction concise and readable.

4) Entry Point Protection (if __name__ == '__main__':): Ensures that certain code blocks run only when intended, aiding in modularity and preventing side effects during imports.
