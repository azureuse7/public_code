# To use merge(values( in Terraform, you typically combine it with other functions or use it directly within resource 
# definitions or variable assignments. Here's a basic example demonstrating its usage:

# Let's say you have two maps defined as local variables in your Terraform configuration:


locals {
  map1 = {
    key1 = "value1"
    key2 = "value2"
  }

  map2 = {
    key3 = "value3"
    key4 = "value4"
  }
}

# Now, if you want to merge the values of these two maps into a single list, you can use merge() 
# Function with values() function like this:


locals {
    merged_values = merge(values(local.map1), values(local.map2))
}

# In this example, values(local.map1) returns a list ["value1", "value2"], and values(local.map2) 
# returns a list ["value3", "value4"]. Then, the merge() function combines these two lists into a single list
#  ["value1", "value2", "value3", "value4"], which is stored in the merged_values local variable.

# You can then use merged_values in other parts of your Terraform configuration, such as passing it as an argument to a resource or using it in a conditional expression.

# Here's an example demonstrating how you might use merged_values as an argument to a resource:


resource "example_resource" "example" {
  values = local.merged_values
}
# This would assign the merged list of values to the values argument of the example_resource.
