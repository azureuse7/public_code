## What are Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)?

Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) are a Kubernetes feature that allows you to specify the minimum number or percentage of replicas of a pod that must remain available during voluntary disruptions. Voluntary disruptions include actions like:

- Node maintenance or draining: When a node is taken down for maintenance, Kubernetes tries to evict pods gracefully.
- Cluster autoscaling: Scaling down nodes can lead to pod evictions.
- Manual interventions: Such as deleting a pod manually.

PDBs ensure that your application maintains a certain level of availability during these operations, preventing scenarios where too many pods are down simultaneously, which could degrade your application's performance or availability.
