# Kubernetes - Secrets

## Step-01: Introduction
- Kubernetes Secrets let you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys. 
- Storing confidential information in a Secret is safer and more flexible than putting it directly in a Pod definition or in a container image. 

## Step-02: Create Secret for MySQL DB Password
### 
```
# Mac
echo -n 'dbpassword11' | base64

# URL: https://www.base64encode.org
```
### Create Kubernetes Secrets manifest
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-db-password
#type: Opaque means that from kubernetes's point of view the contents of this Secret is unstructured.
#It can contain arbitrary key-value pairs. 
type: Opaque
data:
  # Output of echo -n 'Redhat1449' | base64
  db-password: ZGJwYXNzd29yZDEx
```
## Step-03: Update secret in MySQL Deployment for DB Password
```yml
          env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mysql-db-password
                  key: db-password
```

## Step-04: Update secret in UWA Deployment
- UMS means User Management Microservice
```yml
            - name: DB_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mysql-db-password
                  key: db-password
```

## Step-05: Create & Test
```
# Create All Objects
kubectl apply -f kube-manifests/

# List Pods
kubectl get pods

# Get Public IP of Application
kubectl get svc

# Access Application
http://<External-IP-from-get-service-output>
Username: admin101
Password: password101
```

## Step-06: Clean-Up
- Delete all k8s objects created as part of this section
```
# Delete All
kubectl delete -f kube-manifests/

# List Pods
kubectl get pods

# Verify sc, pvc, pv
kubectl get sc,pvc,pv
```

====================================================

- In Kubernetes, Secrets are objects that store sensitive data such as passwords, OAuth tokens, SSH keys, and other secrets. These are intended to be more secure than putting confidential data directly into a Pod specification or in a Docker image. Using secrets, you can manage and store your sensitive data in a more controlled and flexible way.

##### How Secrets Work in Kubernetes
- Secrets are stored within Kubernetes API server and can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables to be used by a pod. Secrets are only sent to nodes where they are needed by pods, and Kubernetes tries to keep them in memory rather than writing to disk. However, secrets are stored unencrypted in etcd by default, though you can set up etcd to encrypt them at rest.

##### Creating and Managing Secrets
- You can create a secret in several ways:
```
1) Using kubectl to create a secret from literals:
```

kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=password=myPassword --from-literal=username=myUsername
2) Creating a secret from a file:

- First, you might create a file with the secret data, and then use kubectl to create the secret:

```
echo -n 'myUsername' > ./username.txt
echo -n 'myPassword' > ./password.txt
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-file=username=./username.txt --from-file=password=./password.txt
```
3) Writing a YAML file for a secret:

- You can also define a secret using a YAML file. Here's an example:
```

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: bXlVc2VybmFtZQ==  # base64 encoded data
  password: bXlQYXNzd29yZA==  # base64 encoded data
```
- Then apply it with kubectl:
```

kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
```
##### Using Secrets in Pods
Secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables in a pod. Hereâ€™s an example of each:

##### As an Environment Variable:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: myimage
    env:
      - name: USERNAME
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: my-secret
            key: username
      - name: PASSWORD
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: my-secret
            key: password
```
##### As a Volume:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: myimage
    volumeMounts:
    - name: secret-volume
      mountPath: "/etc/secret"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: secret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: my-secret
```
In this setup, the secret my-secret is mounted into the container as files in the **/etc/secret** directory.

##### Best Practices for Using Secrets
- Limit access to secrets by using appropriate RBAC policies to control who can read and write secrets.
- **Use namespaces to limit** the scope of secrets to those who need them.
- **Consider enabling encryption** at rest for your Kubernetes cluster to protect secrets.
- **Rotate secrets periodically** and revoke the old ones.
- **Avoid logging secrets** accidentally by ensuring they are not included in application logs.
  
By properly handling secrets in Kubernetes, you can enhance the security of your applications by keeping sensitive data out of your application code and container images.
