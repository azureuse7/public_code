Load Balancer Configuration Below is a comprehensive framework of preventive measures, detection strategies, recovery actions, and resolution steps for load balancer configuration issues on Kubernetes clusters hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

### Context and Common Issues

Load Balancer configuration issues generally manifest as:

*   Services not becoming accessible externally.
    
*   Pods behind the load balancer not passing health checks, leading to no available endpoints.
    
*   Incorrect or missing annotations required by the respective cloud provider’s load balancer controller.
    
*   Mismatches between Service/Ingress specifications and the actual cloud provider configuration (e.g., incorrect IP modes, unsupported protocols, missing target group tags, or firewall rules).
    

### Prevention

1.  **Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Version Control:**
    
    *   Define your Kubernetes Services, Ingresses, and associated annotations in code. Use tools like Helm, Kustomize, or Terraform (for underlying cloud infra) to ensure consistent, well-reviewed configurations.
        
    *   Storing configurations in Git and employing GitOps workflows help prevent drift and unintended manual changes.
        
2.  **Adhere to Provider-Specific Best Practices:**
    
    *   For **AKS**:
        
        *   Follow Azure’s documented annotations for the service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-\* fields.
            
        *   Use Standard Load Balancers and Managed Identities as recommended in recent AKS docs.
            
    *   For **EKS**:
        
        *   Use the AWS Load Balancer Controller for ingress/ALB and correct annotations (alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/\*) as documented.
            
        *   For NLB or CLB load balancers, ensure the Service type=LoadBalancer fields align with required annotations (service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type, service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol, etc.).
            
3.  **Validation via Admission Webhooks and Policies:**
    
    *   Employ Gatekeeper/OPA or Kyverno policies to enforce mandatory annotations and configurations on Services/Ingress objects before deployment.
        
    *   Set rules that reject configurations missing required fields or using deprecated APIs.
        
4.  **Documentation and Runbooks:**
    
    *   Maintain internal documentation describing required fields, annotations, and known constraints for each environment (AKS vs. EKS).
        
    *   Educate platform teams and developers on proper load balancer configuration conventions.
        
5.  **Automated Testing in Pre-Production Environments:**
    
    *   Test load balancer provisioning in non-production clusters. Run integration tests to confirm that Services and Ingresses are correctly exposed, and pods are reachable externally.
        
    *   Use canary deployments or blue-green patterns to verify that new changes don’t break load balancer configurations in production.
        

### Detection

1.  **Kubernetes Events and Logs:**
    
    *   Check kubectl describe service or kubectl describe ingress for events related to load balancer creation failures.
        
    *   Look for error events such as “Failed to create load balancer” or “Error applying load balancer configuration.”
        
2.  **Cloud Provider Logs and Metrics:**
    
    *   For **AKS**, enable logging for the Azure Load Balancer resource and review activity logs in Azure Monitor or Log Analytics.
        
    *   For **EKS**, use AWS CloudWatch Logs and the AWS Load Balancer Controller logs. Inspect Target Group health checks and CloudTrail logs to detect misconfiguration.
        
3.  **Health Check Analysis:**
    
    *   Monitor readiness and liveness probes for Pods behind the load balancer. If these fail, the load balancer may not route traffic correctly.
        
    *   Confirm the application-level endpoints are responding with expected HTTP codes.
        
4.  **Prometheus/Grafana Dashboards:**
    
    *   Integrate metrics from the load balancer (via Cloud provider metrics adapters) into Prometheus and visualize through Grafana.
        
    *   Set alerts for high error rates, unusual latency, or sudden drops in backend healthy targets.
        
5.  **Continuous Synthetic Testing:**
    
    *   Employ periodic synthetic tests (e.g., using cURL in a CronJob or external uptime monitors) to ensure public endpoints are reachable and correctly routed.
        

### Recovery Actions

1.  **Roll Back to Last Known Good Configuration:**
    
    *   If a recent change introduced a bad annotation or a breaking configuration, revert to a previous commit of the configuration manifest.
        
    *   Use GitOps or CI/CD pipelines with rollback capabilities.
        
2.  **Reapply or Update Load Balancer-Related Annotations:**
    
    *   Correct or add missing annotations on the Service or Ingress resources.
        
    *   For AKS: Ensure service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-resource-group and other required fields are correct.
        
    *   For EKS: Verify alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme, alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type, and other controller-specific annotations.
        
3.  **Manually Trigger a Service Reconciliation:**
    
    *   Delete and re-create the Service (if non-disruptive) to force the cloud controller manager to re-attempt provisioning.
        
    *   For Ingress, updating annotations or toggling a parameter might prompt a reload of the ingress controller configuration.
        
4.  **Check Networking/Firewall/NSG Rules:**
    
    *   In AKS, ensure the Network Security Group (NSG) and user-defined routes allow inbound traffic to the node pool from the load balancer’s frontend.
        
    *   In EKS, confirm that Security Groups attached to the worker nodes and load balancer are correct and allow the required ports and protocols.
        
5.  **Ensure the Required Cloud Provider Controllers are Running:**
    
    *   For EKS: Make sure the AWS Load Balancer Controller deployment is healthy and logs show successful reconciliation.
        
    *   For AKS: Check the Azure cloud-controller-manager and cloud-node-manager pods are running without errors.
        

### Resolution Steps (Root Cause Analysis and Permanent Fixes)

1.  **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):**
    
    *   Investigate the sequence of changes leading to the load balancer issue.
        
    *   Identify any missing or incorrect annotation that triggered the misconfiguration.
        
    *   Determine if a regression occurred due to a cluster upgrade (e.g., AKS/EKS version upgrade changed behavior).
        
2.  **Update Documentation and Runbooks:**
    
    *   Reflect any new findings about annotations, provider-specific nuances, or network prerequisites in your internal documentation.
        
    *   Add or refine troubleshooting steps in the runbook to shorten resolution times in the future.
        
3.  **Strengthen Admission Controls and Validation:**
    
    *   Based on the RCA, add or tighten policies in OPA/Gatekeeper/Kyverno to prevent such misconfigurations.
        
    *   Consider adding validation webhooks that verify essential Service or Ingress fields before allowing the object creation.
        
4.  **Enhance CI/CD Pipelines with Configuration Scanning:**
    
    *   Integrate static analysis tools that detect missing load balancer annotations or invalid configurations before manifests reach the cluster.
        
    *   Use tools like kubeval or konfiguration checks, combined with custom rulesets for provider-specific fields.
        
5.  **Improve Monitoring and Alerts:**
    
    *   Add proactive alerts that warn when Services remain pending load balancer allocation for too long or when target groups show 0 healthy targets.
        
    *   Implement Slack or Email notifications for load balancer events, ensuring the team is quickly informed of emerging issues.
        

### Summary

By applying a holistic approach—prevention (proper configuration, IaC, policies), detection (logs, events, metrics), recovery (rollbacks, annotation fixes), and thorough resolution steps (RCA, documentation updates, improved validation)—you can maintain robust and reliable load balancer configurations in AKS and EKS. Over time, these practices drastically reduce downtime, improve reliability, and enhance the operability of Kubernetes-based applications.
