Node Unhealthy - Out of Memory **Prevention Measures:**

1.  **Set Resource Requests and Limits:**
    
    *   **Action:** Define appropriate memory requests and limits for all pods.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Ensures the Kubernetes scheduler can efficiently allocate resources and prevent overcommitment of memory on nodes.
        
2.  **Implement Resource Quotas and LimitRanges:**
    
    *   **Action:** Apply ResourceQuotas to namespaces to cap total memory usage and use LimitRanges to set default minimum and maximum memory limits for pods.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Prevents any single namespace or pod from consuming excessive memory resources.
        
3.  **Optimize Applications:**
    
    *   **Action:** Review and optimize application code to reduce memory usage and fix memory leaks.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Reduces the overall memory footprint of applications, preventing unexpected memory spikes.
        
4.  **Use Minimal Base Images:**
    
    *   **Action:** Utilize lightweight container images (e.g., Alpine Linux) for your applications.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Decreases the memory overhead of containers, leaving more memory available for application processes.
        
5.  **Configure Eviction Policies:**
    
    *   **Action:** Adjust kubelet's evictionHard and evictionSoft thresholds to manage memory pressure proactively.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Allows the kubelet to evict less critical pods before the node runs completely out of memory.
        
6.  **Node Capacity Planning:**
    
    *   **Action:** Regularly assess node resource utilization and plan for scaling (vertically or horizontally) when necessary.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Ensures nodes have sufficient memory to handle workloads without reaching critical limits.
        
7.  **Implement Autoscaling:**
    
    *   **Action:** Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) to adjust resources based on real-time demand.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Automatically adjusts resources to match workload demands, preventing resource exhaustion.
        
8.  **Use Memory Limits in Runtime Environments:**
    
    *   **Action:** Configure application runtimes (e.g., JVM heap sizes) to respect container memory limits.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Prevents applications from exceeding their allocated memory, which can lead to OOM kills.
        

**Detection Mechanisms:**

1.  **Monitoring Tools:**
    
    *   **Action:** Deploy monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana to track memory usage of nodes and pods.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Provides real-time visibility into resource utilization, enabling early detection of memory issues.
        
2.  **Set Up Alerts:**
    
    *   **Action:** Configure alerting rules to notify administrators when memory usage exceeds defined thresholds.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Allows for prompt response before the situation leads to node instability.
        
3.  **Use Kubernetes Metrics:**
    
    *   **Action:** Regularly check kubectl top nodes and kubectl top pods for resource usage statistics.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Helps identify pods or nodes that are consuming excessive memory.
        
4.  **Monitor Events and Logs:**
    
    *   **Action:** Watch for OOMKill events and analyze logs for memory-related errors.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Provides insights into when and why pods are terminated due to memory issues.
        
5.  **Health Probes:**
    
    *   **Action:** Implement readiness and liveness probes in pod specifications.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Detects unhealthy pods that may be consuming abnormal amounts of memory.
        
6.  **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):**
    
    *   **Action:** Use APM tools to monitor application-level memory usage and performance.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Identifies memory leaks and inefficiencies within the application code.
        

**Recovery Actions:**

1.  **Pod Eviction and Rescheduling:**
    
    *   **Action:** Allow Kubernetes to evict pods under memory pressure and reschedule them on nodes with available resources.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Balances the load across the cluster, alleviating memory pressure on affected nodes.
        
2.  **Restart Failed Pods:**
    
    *   **Action:** Ensure pods have appropriate restartPolicy settings to allow automatic restarts.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Minimizes downtime by quickly recovering from transient memory issues.
        
3.  **Scale the Cluster:**
    
    *   **Action:** Add more nodes to the cluster when memory utilization is consistently high.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Provides additional resources to handle the workload, reducing the risk of nodes running out of memory.
        
4.  **Clean Up Unused Resources:**
    
    *   **Action:** Delete obsolete pods, completed jobs, and other unused resources.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Frees up memory and other resources on the nodes.
        
5.  **Throttling and Backoff Mechanisms:**
    
    *   **Action:** Implement rate limiting and exponential backoff in applications.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Prevents applications from overwhelming system resources during high load periods.
        
6.  **Node Maintenance:**
    
    *   **Action:** Cordon and drain nodes experiencing hardware issues and perform necessary maintenance.
        
    *   **Reasoning:** Ensures that workloads are moved to healthy nodes while the affected node is fixed.
        

**Resolution Steps:**

1.  **Identify High Memory Consumers:**
    
    *   **Action:** Use monitoring tools to pinpoint pods or processes with excessive memory usage.
