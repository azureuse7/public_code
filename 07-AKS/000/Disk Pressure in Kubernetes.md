**Disk Pressure in Kubernetes**

Disk Pressure is a condition indicating that a Kubernetes node is running low on available disk space or inodes. When the kubelet detects that the available disk resources on a node fall below certain thresholds, it sets the node condition to DiskPressure. This can lead to pod evictions and prevent new pods from being scheduled on the affected node.

### **Prevention**

1.  **Monitor Disk Usage Regularly**:
    
    *   **Implement Monitoring Tools**: Use tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to continuously monitor disk space and inode usage on nodes.
        
    *   **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts to notify administrators when disk usage exceeds predefined thresholds.
        
2.  **Configure Log Rotation**:
    
    *   **Log Management**: Use log rotation mechanisms like **logrotate** to prevent logs from consuming excessive disk space.
        
    *   **Centralized Logging**: Offload logs to centralized logging systems such as the **ELK stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or **Fluentd**.
        
3.  **Enable Image Garbage Collection**:
    
    *   **Kubelet Configuration**: Set up kubelet to automatically remove unused Docker images by configuring imageGCHighThresholdPercent and imageGCLowThresholdPercent.
        
    *   **Regular Cleanup**: Schedule regular cleanup tasks to remove dangling images and containers.
        
4.  **Provision Adequate Disk Space**:
    
    *   **Capacity Planning**: Ensure that nodes have sufficient disk space based on the workloads they will handle.
        
    *   **Use Larger Disks**: Opt for nodes with larger disks or attach additional storage volumes as needed.
        
5.  **Implement Resource Quotas**:
    
    *   **Namespace Quotas**: Use Kubernetes **ResourceQuotas** to limit the amount of disk space that pods in a namespace can consume.
        
    *   **Limit Ranges**: Define **LimitRanges** to prevent pods from requesting excessive ephemeral storage.
        
6.  **Optimize Applications**:
    
    *   **Efficient Storage Use**: Design applications to minimize disk usage and clean up temporary files after use.
        
    *   **Ephemeral Storage**: Use ephemeral storage judiciously and prefer **Persistent Volumes** for data that needs to persist.
        
7.  **Regular Maintenance**:
    
    *   **Automated Cleanup**: Schedule cron jobs or use systemd timers to automate the cleanup of temporary files and directories.
        
    *   **Audit Disk Usage**: Periodically audit disk usage to identify and remove unnecessary data.
        
8.  **Avoid Local Data Storage**:
    
    *   **External Storage Solutions**: Use network-attached storage solutions like **NFS**, **Ceph**, or **AWS EBS** volumes instead of local node storage.
        
    *   **Stateful Applications**: For stateful applications, use **StatefulSets** with persistent storage to manage data appropriately.
        
9.  **Set Eviction Thresholds**:
    
    *   **Adjust Kubelet Settings**: Configure kubelet eviction thresholds (evictionHard and evictionSoft) to trigger eviction of pods before critical disk pressure occurs.
        
    *   **Priority Classes**: Assign priority classes to pods to control which pods are evicted first during resource contention.
        
10.  **Implement Best Practices**:
    
    *   **Immutable Infrastructure**: Use immutable infrastructure patterns where nodes are replaced rather than upgraded.
        
    *   **Container Best Practices**: Build lean container images and avoid writing unnecessary data to the container's filesystem.
        

### **Detection**

1.  **Check Node Conditions**:
    
    *   **Kubectl Describe**: Run kubectl describe node to check for the DiskPressure condition.
        
    *   **Node Status**: Monitor the node's status for any signs of disk-related issues.
        
2.  **Use Monitoring Tools**:
    
    *   **Metrics Server**: Deploy the Kubernetes **Metrics Server** to collect resource metrics.
        
    *   **Dashboard Visualization**: Use the **Kubernetes Dashboard** or third-party dashboards to visualize disk usage.
        
3.  **Inspect Kubernetes Events**:
    
    *   **Get Events**: Use kubectl get events --all-namespaces to look for events related to disk pressure or pod evictions.
        
    *   **Event Filtering**: Filter events for keywords like DiskPressure, Evicted, or Failed.
        
4.  **Analyze Logs**:
    
    *   **Kubelet Logs**: Check kubelet logs for warnings or errors related to disk space using journalctl -u kubelet.
        
    *   **System Logs**: Inspect system logs for disk I/O errors or filesystem issues.
        
5.  **Monitor Pod Evictions**:
    
    *   **Pod Status**: Use kubectl get pods --all-namespaces to find pods in Evicted or Failed states.
        
    *   **Describe Pods**: Run kubectl describe pod to get more details on why a pod was evicted.
        
6.  **Set Up Alerts**:
    
    *   **Alerting Systems**: Integrate with alerting tools like **Alertmanager** to receive notifications when disk usage exceeds thresholds.
        
    *   **Custom Scripts**: Use custom scripts or tools to check disk usage and send alerts via email or messaging platforms.
        

### **Recovery Action**

1.  **Clean Up Disk Space**:
    
    *   **Remove Unnecessary Files**: Identify and delete unnecessary log files, temporary data, and unused application data.
        
    *   **Clear Package Caches**: Clean up package manager caches (e.g., apt-get clean for Debian-based systems).
        
2.  **Image and Container Cleanup**:
    
    *   **Docker Prune**: Run docker system prune -a to remove all unused images, containers, networks, and volumes.
        
    *   **Kubelet Garbage Collection**: Ensure kubelet's garbage collection is functioning and properly configured.
        
3.  **Increase Disk Capacity**:
    
    *   **Add Storage**: Attach additional storage volumes to the node if possible.
        
    *   **Resize Disks**: Resize existing disks if the cloud provider or infrastructure allows.
        
4.  **Reschedule Pods**:
    
    *   **Drain Node**: Use kubectl drain to safely evict pods and free up disk space.
        
    *   **Rebalance Workloads**: Adjust scheduling to distribute disk-intensive workloads across multiple nodes.
        
5.  **Compress Logs**:
    
    *   **Log Compression**: Compress large log files to reduce disk space usage.
        
    *   **Archive Old Logs**: Move old logs to external storage or archive them.
        
6.  **Remove Orphaned Resources**:
    
    *   **Delete Unused Volumes**: Identify and delete unused **PersistentVolumeClaims** and **PersistentVolumes**.
        
    *   **Clean Orphaned Pods**: Remove any orphaned pods or resources that are not being managed.
        
7.  **Restart Services**:
    
    *   **Restart Kubelet**: If necessary, restart the kubelet service to recover from transient issues.
        
    *   **System Reboot**: As a last resort, reboot the node to clear temporary states.
        
8.  **Scale Infrastructure**:
    
    *   **Add Nodes**: Increase the number of nodes in the cluster to distribute workloads.
        
    *   **Use Auto-Scaling**: Implement cluster auto-scaling to automatically add resources when needed.
