#### What Does Subscription Quota Exceeded Mean?
For managed Kubernetes platforms like AKS and EKS, your underlying infrastructure is bound by certain service-level quotas (also known as service limits). These quotas apply at various resource levels—such as the number of virtual machines (nodes), load balancers, IP addresses, CPU/GPU cores, and more. Hitting a quota limit can cause cluster operations to fail, such as:

Unable to provision new nodes in a node pool.
Inability to create new load balancers or Persistent Volumes.
Pod scheduling failures because no additional nodes can be scaled out.
When these quota limits are exceeded, scaling out or even performing routine cluster operations may fail, potentially impacting application uptime and performance.

Prevention Strategies
Proactive Capacity Planning

Forecast Future Demand: Before deployment, estimate resource needs for peak and off-peak periods. Use historical application usage metrics and known traffic patterns to project CPU, memory, storage, and network requirements.
Right-Sizing Node Pools: Start with appropriately sized node pools and instance types that can handle expected workloads. Overly small nodes might cause a higher count of nodes, quickly hitting quotas.
Reserve Enough IP Addresses: For AKS, you need to ensure sufficient IP addresses in the subnet, and for EKS, ensure adequate ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces). This prevents hitting network-related quotas early on.
Request Increased Quotas in Advance

Azure:
For AKS on Azure, certain default quotas (like total cores per region) might be low. Proactively request quota increases from Azure support through the Azure Portal before your environment scales.
AWS:
For EKS on AWS, limits like total EC2 instances per region or load balancer quotas might be reached. Submit service limit increase requests well before you hit production scale.
Implement Autoscaling with Constraints

Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) & Cluster Autoscaler (CA): Autoscalers can unexpectedly cause spikes in resource creation. Configure sensible maximum boundaries for the number of nodes the Cluster Autoscaler can add.
Resource Quotas in Kubernetes Namespaces: Set namespace-level resource quotas to prevent a single team or application from consuming all available cluster capacity.
Use Managed Nodegroups and Spot Instances (EKS)

If you anticipate unpredictable demand, consider mixing on-demand and spot instances. This can help maintain capacity while controlling costs. Ensure you have enough allocated quota for both instance types.
Regular Quota Audits

Periodic Checks: Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) pipelines to periodically check available quotas. Incorporate these checks into your CI/CD process to catch potential shortfalls early.
Documentation of Limits: Keep a living document or runbook that details all applied quotas, current usage, and the process to request increases.
Detection Strategies
Monitoring and Alerts at the Cloud Provider Level

Azure Monitor (AKS):
Use Azure Monitor to track usage metrics of cores, IP addresses, managed disks, and load balancers. Set alerts when usage approaches 80% of quota limits.
Amazon CloudWatch (EKS):
Configure CloudWatch metrics and set alarms for resource usage nearing quotas. For example, monitor EC2 instance counts, EBS volumes, and Elastic Load Balancer counts.
Cluster Autoscaler Logging and Metrics

Cluster Autoscaler Logs:
If the autoscaler reports failed attempts to scale due to resource constraints, alert on these log messages.
Scheduler and Event Logs:
The Kubernetes scheduler or the event logs may report insufficient resources or failed pod scheduling attempts. Configure log aggregation and alert on repeated failures.
Integration With Observability Tools

Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to visualize quota-related metrics.
Set alerts via Alertmanager (Prometheus) or similar tools when approaching quota thresholds.
Cloud Provider APIs and CLI Tools

Periodically query quota usage via CLI (e.g., az vm list-usage for Azure or aws service-quotas list-service-quotas for AWS) and run these checks in automated scripts. Trigger Slack/email notifications if thresholds exceed a safe margin.
Recovery Strategies
Immediate Scale-Down or Clean-Up

Free Up Resources:
If you’ve hit a quota limit, consider temporarily scaling down non-critical workloads, removing unused node pools, or deleting orphaned resources (like stale load balancers or unused IP addresses).
Graceful Shutdown of Non-Essential Services:
Halt development or staging clusters temporarily to free up quota for critical production services.
Request Quota Increase Urgently

Azure:
Through the Azure Portal, raise a support request for a quota increase. This often can be expedited with the correct support plan.
AWS:
Use the AWS Service Quotas console or open a support ticket. Provide details about why you need more capacity, expected usage patterns, and timelines.
Change Node Types or Regions

Use Different Instance Families/Types:
If you can’t get a quota increase fast enough, pivot to an instance type with available capacity. For example, switch from a VM size or EC2 family that’s hitting limits to a different size or family.
Deploy in a Different Region:
If your region’s limits are reached and cannot be increased quickly, consider temporarily deploying additional workloads in another region where you have quota headroom.
Temporary Resource Reallocation

Reconfigure your autoscaling policies to run fewer nodes per node pool if they are unnecessarily large. Distribute workloads across multiple clusters if possible, assuming you have not exhausted global or multi-regional quotas.
Redeploy Infrastructure With Adjusted VNet/IP Settings (AKS)

If IP exhaustion is the issue, consider using Azure CNI with a larger subnet or using Azure’s Pod Security Groups and IPAM solutions. Redeploying with larger subnets can instantly free you from IP address constraints.
Long-Term Architectural Adjustments

Refactor Workloads:
If certain workloads are too resource-heavy, consider refactoring them or using more efficient container images.
Adopt Multi-Cluster Strategies:
Instead of a single large cluster, distribute workloads across multiple smaller clusters, each with its own quotas.
Summary
Prevention: Perform capacity planning, proactively request quota increases, implement resource constraints, and regularly audit your quota usage.
Detection: Set up monitoring and alerting at multiple layers (cloud provider, cluster logs, external observability tools) to detect approaching quota limits early.
Recovery: Temporarily free up resources, urgently request quota increases, adjust instance types or regions, and consider architectural changes for long-term resilience.
By following these recommendations, you can minimize downtime and ensure that your AKS and EKS environments remain robust and scalable without unexpectedly hitting subscription quota limits.
