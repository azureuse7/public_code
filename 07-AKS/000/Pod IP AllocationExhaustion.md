Pod IP Allocation / Exhaustion**Preventing, Detecting, and Resolving Pod IP Allocation Exhaustion in AKS and EKS**

Pod IP exhaustion is a common issue in Kubernetes clusters, especially in managed services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). When the cluster runs out of IP addresses to assign to pods, it can lead to deployment failures and service disruptions. Below are detailed strategies for prevention, detection, recovery actions, and resolution of Pod IP allocation/exhaustion issues in AKS and EKS.

### **1\. Prevention**

#### **1.1 Proper Network Planning**

*   **Plan CIDR Ranges Carefully**:
    
    *   **AKS**: Allocate a larger CIDR block for your Virtual Network (VNet) and subnets to accommodate future scaling. The default /24 subnet might be insufficient for large deployments.
        
    *   **EKS**: Choose VPC and subnet CIDR blocks that provide ample IP addresses. Consider using multiple CIDR blocks in your VPC to expand IP address capacity.
        
*   **Use Private IP Address Ranges**:
    
    *   Ensure that your cluster uses private IP ranges as per RFC 1918 to avoid conflicts and maximize available IP space.
        

#### **1.2 Utilize Advanced Networking Modes**

*   **AKS**:
    
    *   **Azure CNI Overlay**: Use Azure CNI Overlay networking, which allows pods to use IP addresses from a different, non-routable IP address space, reducing pressure on your VNet's IP addresses.
        
    *   **Kubenet Networking**: Consider using Kubenet, which uses NAT for pod outbound traffic, thus consuming fewer IP addresses from the VNet.
        
*   **EKS**:
    
    *   **Custom Networking**: Configure the AWS VPC CNI plugin to assign pod IPs from secondary CIDR blocks or dedicated subnets.
        
    *   **IPv6 Support**: Enable IPv6 for your VPC and EKS cluster to vastly increase the available IP address space.
        

#### **1.3 Limit Pods Per Node**

*   **Adjust maxPods Setting**:
    
    *   Limit the maximum number of pods that can run on a node to reduce IP consumption.
        
    *   **AKS**: Use the --max-pods parameter when creating the cluster.
        
    *   **EKS**: Configure the maxPods setting in the node's kubelet configuration.
        

#### **1.4 Implement IP Reuse Strategies**

*   **Enable IP Address Recycling**:
    
    *   Ensure that terminated pods release their IP addresses promptly.
        
    *   Use shorter DHCP lease times if applicable.
        

#### **1.5 Optimize Workload Deployments**

*   **Use Fewer, More Efficient Pods**:
    
    *   Combine workloads where appropriate to reduce the total number of pods.
        
    *   Use higher-capacity nodes to run more containers per pod when feasible.
        

#### **1.6 Employ Network Policies Wisely**

*   **Avoid Unnecessary Pod IP Allocation**:
    
    *   Use services and ingress controllers to manage traffic without assigning additional IPs to pods unnecessarily.
        

### **2\. Detection**

#### **2.1 Monitor IP Address Utilization**

*   **Use Monitoring Tools**:
    
    *   **AKS**: Utilize Azure Monitor and Container Insights to track IP address usage and subnet capacity.
        
    *   **EKS**: Leverage CloudWatch metrics and the aws-node daemonset logs for IP allocation details.
        

#### **2.2 Set Up Alerts**

*   **Configure Threshold Alerts**:
    
    *   Set up alerts to notify you when IP address utilization reaches critical levels (e.g., 80% usage).
        

#### **2.3 Analyze Kubernetes Events and Logs**

*   **Check for IP Allocation Failures**:
    
    *   Look for events indicating pod scheduling failures due to IP exhaustion.
        
    *   Use kubectl get events to identify issues related to IP allocation.
        

#### **2.4 Use Diagnostic Commands**

*   **Inspect Node and Pod Status**:
    
    *   Run kubectl describe node to see the number of allocated pod IPs.
        
    *   Use kubectl get pods -o wide to list pod IP addresses and identify patterns.
        

### **3\. Recovery Actions**

#### **3.1 Expand IP Address Space**

*   **Add Additional CIDR Blocks**:
    
    *   **AKS**: Add new subnets to your VNet and configure the cluster to use them.
        
    *   **EKS**: Use VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) to add secondary CIDR blocks to your VPC.
        

#### **3.2 Update Network Plugin Configurations**

*   **Modify CNI Settings**:
    
    *   Adjust the CNI plugin configurations to enable features like prefix delegation or increased IP address utilization efficiency.
        

#### **3.3 Scale Down Non-Critical Workloads**

*   **Free Up IP Addresses**:
    
    *   Temporarily scale down or pause non-essential deployments to release IP addresses for critical services.
        

#### **3.4 Restart CNI Pods**

*   **Recycle Network Components**:
    
    *   Delete and let Kubernetes recreate the CNI plugin pods (aws-node in EKS, azure-cni in AKS) to refresh IP allocations.
        

#### **3.5 Reboot Nodes**

*   **Clear Stale IP Allocations**:
    
    *   As a last resort, reboot nodes to release any IP addresses that might be held due to issues.
        

### **4\. Resolution**

#### **4.1 Reconfigure Cluster Networking**

*   **Recreate the Cluster with Larger IP Ranges**:
    
    *   If expansion isn't feasible, consider recreating the cluster with appropriately sized CIDR blocks.
        

#### **4.2 Implement IP Address Conservation Techniques**

*   **Use Pod CIDR Overlapping**:
    
    *   **EKS**: Enable features like prefix delegation (ENABLE\_PREFIX\_DELEGATION) to allow multiple pods to share a single ENI, conserving IP addresses.
        

#### **4.3 Migrate to Alternative Networking Models**

*   **Explore Other CNI Plugins**:
    
    *   Consider using alternative CNI plugins like Calico or Cilium that might offer better IP address management for your use case.
        

#### **4.4 Enable IPv6 Networking**

*   **Switch to IPv6**:
    
    *   Migrate to IPv6 addressing to expand the address space significantly. Both AKS and EKS offer support for IPv6.
        

#### **4.5 Optimize Cluster Autoscaling**

*   **Coordinate with IP Availability**:
    
    *   Ensure that the cluster autoscaler considers IP address availability when scaling nodes and pods.
        

#### **4.6 Regular Maintenance and Auditing**

*   **Periodic Reviews**:
    
    *   Regularly audit IP address usage and adjust resource allocations accordingly.
        
    *   Clean up unused resources like old services or ingresses that might consume IPs.
        

### **Conclusion**

Preventing Pod IP exhaustion requires proactive planning and ongoing management. By properly configuring your cluster's networking, monitoring IP utilization, and being prepared with recovery actions, you can minimize the risk of IP exhaustion. In cases where exhaustion occurs, understanding how to expand IP address space and reconfigure networking settings is crucial for restoring cluster functionality.
