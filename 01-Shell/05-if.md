- Using if statements in Bash is straightforward, allowing you to execute commands conditionally based on whether a specific test evaluates to true or false. 
- Below are the basic syntax and examples of how to use if statements in Bash.

##### Basic Syntax
- The basic structure of an if statement in Bash is:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # commands to execute if condition is true
fi
```
#### Variations
- Using else
```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # commands to execute if condition is true
else
    # commands to execute if condition is false
fi
```
#### Using elif

```bash
if [ condition1 ]; then
    # commands to execute if condition1 is true
elif [ condition2 ]; then
    # commands to execute if condition2 is true
else
    # commands to execute if none of the above conditions are true
fi
```

#### Example 1: Checking if a file exists
```bash
#!/bin/bash

filename="example.txt"

if [ -e "$filename" ]; then
    echo "File '$filename' exists."
else
    echo "File '$filename' does not exist."
fi
```


#### Example 2: Comparing numbers

```bash
#!/bin/bash

a=10
b=20

if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]; then
    echo "$a is less than $b."
else
    echo "$a is not less than $b."
fi
```
#### Example 3: String comparison
```bash
#!/bin/bash

str1="hello"
str2="world"

if [ "$str1" = "$str2" ]; then
    echo "The strings are equal."
else
    echo "The strings are not equal."
fi
```
#### Important Points
- **Spaces**: Ensure you have spaces around brackets [ and ].
- **String** **Comparison**: Use = for equality and != for inequality.
- **Numeric** **Comparison**: Use -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, -ge for numeric comparisons.
- **Test** **Command**: The [ is a synonym for the test command. You can also use [[ for an enhanced test command that supports additional features like regex matching.
  
#### Using [[ for Conditions
- The **[[** construct is a more modern and feature-rich version:

```bash
if [[ $a -lt $b ]]; then
    echo "$a is less than $b."
fi
```
- The **[[** command allows more complex expressions and can handle operators such as **&&** and **||** without needing to quote variables in many cases.

- By following these guidelines, you can effectively use if statements in Bash to control the flow of your scripts based on conditions.

```bash
# Check if file exists
if [ ! -f "$TF_VARS_FILE" ]; then
echo "TFVars file does not exist: $TF_VARS_FILE"
exit 1
fi 
```
#### Components of the Code
1) **if**: This introduces the conditional statement. 

2) **[ ! -f "$TF_VARS_FILE" ]:**

- [ ]: These square brackets denote a test (or conditional expression) in Bash. They are used to evaluate a condition.
-  "**!**"This is a logical NOT operator. It negates the result of the test expression that follows it. So if the test expression evaluates to true, ! changes it to false, and vice versa.
-  "**-f**" **"TF_VARS_FILE"** This tests if the path specified by the variable TF_VARS_FILE is a file.
   -  **-f**: This is a file test operator that checks if a specified file exists and is a regular file (not a directory or a device)
   -  **"TF_VARS_FILE"**: This is the path to the file being checked. It is a variable that should contain the full path or relative path to the file. The quotes around the variable are used to handle any spaces or special characters in the filename or path correctly.
#### Explanation of the Logic
 The conditional expression **[ ! -f "$TF_VARS_FILE" ]** checks:

- Whether the file specified by **TF_VARS_FILE does not exist**.
- If the file does not exist ****(-f "$TF_VARS_FILE" returns false)****, the **!** operator negates this to true, causing the **if** statement to execute the enclosed block of commands.
