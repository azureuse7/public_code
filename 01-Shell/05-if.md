- Using if statements in Bash is straightforward, allowing you to execute commands conditionally based on whether a specific test evaluates to true or false. 
- Below are the basic syntax and examples of how to use if statements in Bash.

##### Basic Syntax
- The basic structure of an if statement in Bash is:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # commands to execute if condition is true
fi
```
#### Variations
- Using else
```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # commands to execute if condition is true
else
    # commands to execute if condition is false
fi
```
#### Using elif

```bash
if [ condition1 ]; then
    # commands to execute if condition1 is true
elif [ condition2 ]; then
    # commands to execute if condition2 is true
else
    # commands to execute if none of the above conditions are true
fi
```

#### Example 1: Checking if a file exists
```bash
#!/bin/bash

filename="example.txt"

if [ -e "$filename" ]; then
    echo "File '$filename' exists."
else
    echo "File '$filename' does not exist."
fi
```


#### Example 2: Comparing numbers

```bash
#!/bin/bash

a=10
b=20

if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]; then
    echo "$a is less than $b."
else
    echo "$a is not less than $b."
fi
```
#### Example 3: String comparison
```bash
#!/bin/bash

str1="hello"
str2="world"

if [ "$str1" = "$str2" ]; then
    echo "The strings are equal."
else
    echo "The strings are not equal."
fi
```
#### Important Points
- **Spaces**: Ensure you have spaces around brackets [ and ].
- **String** **Comparison**: Use = for equality and != for inequality.
- **Numeric** **Comparison**: Use -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, -ge for numeric comparisons.
- **Test** **Command**: The [ is a synonym for the test command. You can also use [[ for an enhanced test command that supports additional features like regex matching.
  
#### Using [[ for Conditions
- The **[[** construct is a more modern and feature-rich version:

```bash
if [[ $a -lt $b ]]; then
    echo "$a is less than $b."
fi
```
- The **[[** command allows more complex expressions and can handle operators such as **&&** and **||** without needing to quote variables in many cases.

- By following these guidelines, you can effectively use if statements in Bash to control the flow of your scripts based on conditions.
