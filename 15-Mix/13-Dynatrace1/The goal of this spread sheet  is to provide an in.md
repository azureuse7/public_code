The **goal** of this spread sheet  is to provide an in-depth overview of our Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) as it shows how our systems are monitored and what remediation we have in place .

The **aim** is to enhance system reliability, improve security posture, and ensure proactive management of potential failure modes through effective monitoring and mitigation strategies in place

We have **Reviewed core components** such as the API server, etcd, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, nodes, pods, services, and networking(how these components interact)

Identified **interdependencies** between components 

We have used **Historical events** (that we could think of)** 

**Brainstorming Sessions**

we have evaluated the **potential impact** of each failure mode 

Assigned **severity levels based on likelihood** and impact, prioritizing failure modes that could cause significant disruptions or security breaches

**Documented** each failure mode with descriptions, effects, 

**Peer Review**
