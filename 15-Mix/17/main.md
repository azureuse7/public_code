Declaring his prophecy and this revelation Hazrat Mirza Sahib wrote, (addressing all religious parties):

“If within six years from today February, 20, 1893, this man does not meet with punishment from God, which is unusual in its poignancy and tragedy and which impresses all and sundry with the fear of the Lord, then let everybody think that I am not from God.”

### Hadith (sound reports stating his descent)

*   **Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 3448 / 2476** — “The son of Mary will **soon descend** among you and **judge justly**; he will **break the cross, kill swine, and abolish jizyah** …” [Sunnah.com+1](https://sunnah.com/bukhari%3A3448?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 155c** — “By Allah, the son of Mary will certainly **descend as a just judge**; he will **break the cross, kill swine, abolish jizyah** …” [Sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com/muslim/1/296-301?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2937a** — Detailed eschatology including Jesus **descending at the white minaret to the east of Damascus**, confronting Dajjāl, and events of Gog and Magog. [Sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com/muslim%3A2937a?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Sunan Abī Dāwūd 4324** — “**There is no prophet between me and him**, that is Jesus; **he will descend**…” (also gives his description). This line explicitly affirms his **prophethood** and his future descent. [Sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com/abudawud%3A4324?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Sunan Ibn Mājah 4078** — Same themes: descent as a just ruler; breaking the cross, killing swine, abolishing jizyah. [Sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com/search?q=break+the+cross+and+kill+the+pigs&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn 1808** (an-Nawawī, citing Muslim) — Mentions his descent at the **white minaret**. [Sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin%3A1808?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

### Hadith proving he returns as a prophet (nabī)

*   **“No prophet between me and him”**:
    
    *   **Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 3442** — “I am the closest to the son of Mary… **there has been no prophet between me and him**.” [Sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com/bukhari%3A3442?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
    *   **Sunan Abī Dāwūd 4324** — “There is **no prophet** between me and him… **he will descend**.” (combines prophethood + return). [Sunnah.com](https://sunnah.com/abudawud%3A4324?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        

> Scholars clarify: Jesus returns **as a prophet of Allah** (his status never ceased) but **follows the Sharīʿa of Muhammad ﷺ** and does not bring a new law—hence “a just judge” among this ummah. See Nawawī’s commentary on Muslim and related explanations. [islam365.io+1](https://islam365.io/topics/descent_isa.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Classical scholarship & consensus notes

*   **Ibn Kathīr** (Tafsīr) states that reports of Jesus’ descent **are mutawātir (mass-transmitted)** and details his descent in Greater Syria. [Islam Answers](https://islamanswers.co.uk/question/are-hadith-about-isa-returning-mutawatir-mass-transmitted/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   Overviews collecting statements from earlier imams (e.g., Ibn al-Qaṭṭān, al-Shawkānī) affirm mutawātir status and scholarly **ijmāʿ** (consensus) on the descent.

### 1) Qur’anic verses (as interpreted in Ahmadiyya literature)

### 

*   **33:40** — “Seal of the Prophets (khatam an-nabiyyīn)”: read the verse itself; Ahmadis argue “seal” = _supreme/validator_, not a blanket ban on **subordinate** prophethood under Islam. [Quran.com](https://quran.com/en/al-ahzab/40?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **4:69** — The fully obedient are joined **with** prophets, truthful, martyrs, righteous; used to argue Islam’s pathway to prophetic companionship/appearance under Muhammad’s sharia. [Quran.com](https://quran.com/en/an-nisa/69?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **62:3** — “Others among them who have not yet joined them”: linked to later-day guidance among non-Arab peoples (see hadith with Salman al-Fārisi). [Quran.com](https://quran.com/62?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **7:35** — Generic address to “Children of Adam… messengers from among you,” cited to show continuity of messengership in principle (while Ahmadis stress no new _law_). [Quran.com](https://quran.com/en/al-araf/35?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **24:55** — Promise of divine succession/khilāfah after the Prophet; used to frame the Messianic revival and later Khilāfat-e-Ahmadiyya. [Quran](https://legacy.quran.com/24/55?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

_(For mainstream non-Ahmadi tafsīr that reads 33:40 as “last prophet,” see for contrast.)_ [Quran.com+1](https://quran.com/en/33%3A40/tafsirs/en-tafsir-maarif-ul-quran?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* * *

### 2) Ṣaḥīḥ ḥadīth the community leans on

### 

*   **Return of the Messiah within the Ummah:** “How will you be when \*\*the son of Mary descends among you and your **imām is from among you**…’” (Bukhārī 3449; Muslim 155 variants). Ahmadis read “your imām from among you” as the Messiah leading from _within_ the Ummah (i.e., not Jesus bodily from 1st-century Palestine, but a follower of Muhammad ﷺ raised in his ummah). [Sunnah.com+2Sunnah.com+2](https://sunnah.com/bukhari%3A3449?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Mujaddid every century:** “Allah will raise for this Ummah at the head of every hundred years someone who will revive its religion.” (Abū Dāwūd 4291; graded ṣaḥīḥ by many). Used to place Ghulam Ahmad at the head of the 14th Hijri century. [Sunnah.com+1](https://sunnah.com/abudawud%3A4291?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

* * *

### 3) Classical “eclipse sign” (Ahmadi reading) + astronomical documentation

### 

*   **Report in al-Dāraqutnī** about **Ramadan lunar & solar eclipses** as a sign for the Mahdi—Ahmadiyya argues fulfilment in **Ramadan 1311 AH (March/April 1894)** and again in 1895; opponents dispute the report’s strength. [ahmadipedia.org+1](https://www.ahmadipedia.org/content/event/8/eclipse-of-the-moon-and-the-sun?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Astronomy records** confirming those eclipses occurred on **13 Ramadan 1311 (Mar 21, 1894)** and **28 Ramadan 1311 (Apr 6, 1894)**. (NASA eclipse catalog pages and technical summaries.) [EclipseWise+2eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov+2](https://www.eclipsewise.com/lunar/LEprime/1801-1900/LE1894Mar21Pprime.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Background explainer from Ahmadi sources** on Qur’an 75:8–10 (“…the moon is eclipsed; the sun and the moon are brought together”) tied to the hadith’s timing. _Note: Salafi critics reject the Dāraqutnī isnād—see representative critique for balance._ [The Review of Religions+2eshaykh.com+2](https://www.reviewofreligions.org/12129/the-sign-of-the-heavens-2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 4) Mirza Ghulam Ahmad’s own claims, revelations and “Signs” (primary texts)

### 

*   **Haqiqat-ul-Wahī (The Philosophy of Divine Revelation)** — his capstone book cataloguing 200+ claimed signs/prophecies and his claim of **non-law-bearing prophethood** under Muhammad ﷺ. Read online or PDF. [Al Islam Online+1](https://www.alislam.org/book/haqiqatul-wahi/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Tadhkirah** — compiled collection of his revelations, dreams and visions (English rendering with sources). [Al Islam Online+1](https://www.alislam.org/book/tadhkirah/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Early treatises around the 1891 claim** (e.g., _Izāla-e-Auhām_, _Fatḥ-e-Islām_, _Taudīh-e-Marām / Elucidation of Objectives_)—lay out death-of-Jesus thesis and the Messiah/Mahdi claim. [Al Islam Online+1](https://www.alislam.org/book/elucidation-of-objectives/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Barāhīn-e-Ahmadiyya** (series) — pre-claim apologetic work that his followers point to as containing early prophecies and divine succor. [Al Islam Online+1](https://www.alislam.org/series/barahin-e-ahmadiyya/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

* * *

### 5) Frequently cited fulfilled-prophecy cases in Ahmadi apologetics

### 

*   **Public “mubāhalah/prayer duel” with John Alexander Dowie** (faith healer of Zion, Illinois) and Dowie’s ruin—documented in contemporary press and Ahmadi periodicals. [Al Islam Online+1](https://www.alislam.org/library/links/00000213.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   **Warning to Rev. John Hugh Smyth-Pigott** (Agapemone) about claiming divinity; Ahmadi sources argue subsequent downfall fits the warning. (Critics contest details; see both sides.)

### 6) What reputable academic overviews say (context, not “proof”)

### 

*   **Yohanan Friedmann, _Prophecy Continuous_ (UC Press, 1989)** — standard scholarly monograph on Ahmadi concept of post-Muhammadan, non-law-bearing prophethood and its medieval roots.

## Notes on scope & debate

### 

*   **“All references”** isn’t realistic in a chat—there are thousands of pages. The items above are the **primary proofs** Ahmadiyya themselves cite (Qur’an/ḥadīth interpreted their way, the 1894–95 eclipses, and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad’s own recorded revelations/signs), plus well-known **case studies** and **academic context**.
    
*   Many **non-Ahmadi scholars** interpret 33:40 as absolute finality and/or reject the Dāraqutnī eclipse report’s authenticity. I’ve included representative contrary sources so you can see the lines of argument. [Quran.com+1](https://quran.com/en/33%3A40/tafsirs/en-tafsir-maarif-ul-quran?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
