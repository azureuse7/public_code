- An SSH key consists of two components: 
- A **public** **key** and a **private** **key**. These keys are generated using cryptographic algorithms, and they work together as a pair. 
- The public key is meant to be shared with others, while the private key must be kept secret and protected. 
- Therefore, the private key remains securely stored on the developer's local machine & the public key can be safely shared with GitHub.

```tf
ssh-keygen -t ed25519

vault write -field=signed_key ssh-<gagan-cluster>/sign/<ggaganaccount>-ssh-role public_key=@$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ttl=60m > signed-cert.pub

ssh -i ./signed-cert.pub -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 azureuser@<ip-address>
```
The sequence of commands you provided is related to using SSH keys for secure access to an Azure AKS instance, with the added layer of signing the SSH key using HashiCorp Vault. 

#### 1. Create the SSH key:
```tf
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```
- **ssh-keygen**: This is a command-line tool used to generate SSH key pairs.
- **-t ed25519**: This option specifies the type of key to generate. **ed25519** is a modern, secure, and efficient elliptic-curve algorithm, preferred over older types like RSA.
  
- This command generates a public and private key pair. By default, the private key is stored in ~/.ssh/id_ed25519, and the public key in ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.

#### 2. Sign the SSH key with Vault:
```tf
vault write -field=signed_key ssh-<egagan-cluster>/sign/<ggagan_key=@$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub ttl=60m > signed-cert.pub
```
- **vault write**: This is a command used to interact with HashiCorp Vault, a tool for securely accessing secrets, keys, and other sensitive data.

- **-field=signed_key**: This flag tells Vault to return only the value of the signed_key field from the response. This field contains the signed SSH key (certificate).

- **ssh-<gagan-cluster-name>/sign/<gagan-account-name>-ssh-role**: This is the Vault path that handles the signing of SSH keys. It represents the role configured in Vault that has permissions to sign SSH keys for this specific EKS cluster and AWS account.

- **public_key=@$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub**: This specifies the public key to be signed, where @ tells Vault to read the content of the file (id_ed25519.pub in this case).

- **tl=60m**: This sets the time-to-live (TTL) for the signed certificate, meaning the certificate will be valid for 60 minutes.

-  **signed-cert.pub:** This redirects the output (the signed certificate) to a file named signed-cert.pub.

The output of this command is a signed SSH certificate stored in signed-cert.pub, which allows temporary SSH access based on the policies defined in the Vault role.

#### 3. SSH to the EC2 instance:
```tf
ssh -i ./signed-cert.pub -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ec2-user@<ip-address>
```
- **ssh**: This is the command used to start an SSH session.

- **-i ./signed-cert.pub**: This specifies the signed SSH certificate to be used for authentication.

- **-i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519:** This specifies the private key corresponding to the public key that was signed. The private key is necessary to prove ownership of the public key.

- **ec2-user@<ip-address>:** This indicates the username (ec2-user is the default user for Amazon Linux instances) and the IP address of the EC2 instance to which you are connecting.

Summary:
- Step 1: Generate an SSH key pair using ed25519.
- Step 2: Sign the public key with HashiCorp Vault, creating a short-lived SSH certificate.
- Step 3: Use the signed certificate and your private key to securely SSH into the EC2 instance.
  
- This approach provides enhanced security by ensuring that only keys signed by a trusted authority (Vault) can access the EC2 instance, with access limited by time (60 minutes in this case).
